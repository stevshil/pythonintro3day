# Instructions

The core detail for this lab is found in the course notes.

You will need the Database created and the SQL data installed, which is found in the Services/ProjectData directory.

A Python script exists to take the data from the CSV and create the SQL script if you think it needs updating.

# Before starting

1. Make sure the Database exists
2. Start the API server on your local machine.
   * This is the **dummyAPI.py** script in the **Services** folder
